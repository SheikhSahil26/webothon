    <pre class="a">About Event
        Conveyed and organised by the Robocon Club of LDCE, Lakshya is the annual Edu-Tech Festival of L.D. College of Engineering, Ahmedabad which is being held for the last 9 years with a unique theme every year. It is a perfect blend of exciting technical and non-technical events and workshops unfolding out of a box of techniques, challenges, learning and lots of excitement.
        
        Every year a unique theme is decided and the main event is organised in accordance with the theme. This year the theme of Lakshya 2022 is “ENVISION” and the fest is scheduled from 27th to 29th April.
        This year we bring you Lakshya’23 where we aim of installing the young minds with the idea of visualising beyond the horizon unfurling the wired mentalism accord of synergy amidst Humans and robots in the forthcoming future, an era ushering with infinite discoveries, transfiguring the seeds of paradoxical ideas into blossoming possible solutions, exploring the manipulation of cubits to the creation of neuromorphic chips and humanoidal robots, procuring inconceivable communication through the combinations of cubits, photons and optical fibre communication foraying into a new realm of automation! Establishing a world of robotic automation, a quantum-level portal connecting the entire planet, paving the way for transparency and traceability, raising productivity in every industry contributing to global economic growth, and thriving with new job prospects. A world that demands the for-seeing needs of the future and replacing it with a world thriving with Automation and infiniteness.
        
        The future of automation beholds a lot of potential for the propensity of human-robot collaboration yet to be discovered by human-kind.
